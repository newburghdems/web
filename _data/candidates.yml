    Dear friends, 

    As I talk to constituents around the district, I hear the same thing from everyone. That we're tired of the empty promises and the ongoing useless partisan rhetoric from official's that gets us nowhere. As a teacher for 31 years as well as an incumbent Cornwall Town Councilwoman, I know a thing or two about hearing everyone's voice, and finding a way to a solution. 

    I can assure you, that as your county legislator I will never stop fighting for for our community and for our Orange County values!
